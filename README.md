Online application (rjdatacollector.herokuapp.com) which collects user email and height information. User is then automatically emailed with the calculated average height and number of uses in the current calculation. 

Application utilizes the Flask framework and PostgreSQL database as well as template files using HTML to design the GUI. The main application is within the 'app.py' file. All other files are supporting files which feed into 'app.py'

Webpage requires certain email configs within my gmail account which I have turned off. Main page still running - not the 'Success' page though.
